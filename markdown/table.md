## Table for Overall Rating and Price

In the last part of the analysis, we can see the data table, where there is the
breakdown of some statistic information base on the data. The users can see two
table. One is overall rating from 1 to 5 with percentage of the reviewers who
give the score respect to each score. Second table provide the bedrooms from
0 to 4 and their average price for each renting place with that many rooms. By
comparing different city, the user can see the historic price and rating from
different cities and years. This will surely give a pleasant view point for any
person who wish to use the Airbnb rooms for their vacations or short term stay.
It will also help the Airbnb landlords find out how fare are their rating
compering to other business model like hotel and motel.

From the data table, we can see a trend in reviews with very high rating (above
4 score). It can seen that New York have relatively higher satisfaction rating
than the order cities. However, the authentic of the data fall
into question. With a high number of people who leave high rating and low number
of people who leave low rating (3 and below), there may be some kind of fraud in
the reporting of these data. Further analysis and research is needed for a complete
understanding if the data is genuine.

The column in the data:
  - Overall satisfaction rating: the value score of satisfaction from 1 to 5 that
  was taken from the table.
  - Percent: the percentage of the each rating in one the respective year and
  city that was collected in the data.
  - Bedrooms: number of renting place with the same number of bedrooms available,
  in this table, we will consider from 0 to 4 (meaning from no Bedroom to 4 bedrooms).
  - Average price: it will show the average price per night to the correspond bedrooms
  in the respective city and year.
