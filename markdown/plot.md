produce good description of the trend of the Airbnb business. From the plot, we
can see the important trend that places with higher price, they tend to have
higher rating score by the reviewers. This can be due to the fact that landlords
would try to satisfy the renters more when they have great place locations. The
general impression from the plots show that there are relatively significant
correlation between overall satisfaction and the price of the renting places. The
more expensive the location is the higher possible rating it would be.
