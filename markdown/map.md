## Concentration of the Host

For first step, we will draw a few maps that show the locations of each host in
the data. To save time and the transparency of project, we will only draw the
first 50 locations in one neighborhood for each city. From these data point on
the map, we will see where the locations of the landlords on the map are. Then,
we can start to get the general idea which section of the neighborhood have the
high concentration of Airbnb landlords. We can draw meaningful conclusion from
maps. One example, in Seattle, there are a high concentration of
the landlords near Downtown Seattle. This would physically make a lot of sense
because it is a touristsâ€™ destination.

The map also contain the interactive feature that will allow the users to zoom in
and out of the map. Also, when the users click on each dot on the maps, it will
show some extra information on the each host in the data.
