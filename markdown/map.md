Airbnb is a business that help advertising and promoting lending out houses or
rooms to renters. They mostly target tourists who have short term stay in few
days. It would be very crucial for landlords and renters to know about the overall
satisfaction of in each locations in different cities to see if the price is a
big factor in the business overall. In this section, we will try to compare
satisfaction of the reviewers with the price per day stay of Airbnb business and
see if there is a trend or correlation. We will divide our analysis to three section.

**Concentration of the Host**:

For first step, we will draw a few maps that show the locations of each host in
the data. To save time and the transparency of project, we will only draw the
first 50 locations in one neighborhood for each city. From these data point on
the map, we will see where the locations of the landlords on the map are. Then,
we can start to get the general idea which section of the neighborhood have the
high concentration of Airbnb landlords. We can draw meaningful conclusion from
maps. One example, in Seattle, there are a high concentration of
the landlords near Downtown Seattle. This would physically make a lot of sense
because it is a touristsâ€™ destination.

The map also contain the interactive feature that will allow the users to zoom in
and out of the map. Also, when the users click on each dot on the maps, it will
show some extra information on the each host in the data.
