## Introduction to Airbnb

Airbnb is a business that connects hosts to guests by facilitating rentals of houses or
rooms owned by a host to guests willing to stay in the space. Listings consist of houses, apartments, shared rooms, and private rooms. Their business mostly targets tourists who wish to stay for a short term, usually a few days. The data we are using can be accessed on Airbnbâ€™s public website, but we are sourcing it from this particular website: http://tomslee.net/airbnb-data-collection-get-the-data. This particular data was collected by Tom Slee, originally for the purposes of investigating the types of rooms rented to Airbnb customers in New York city. We focused on comparing certain metrics from the data between five cities: Chicago, Miami, New York, San Diego, and Seattle. There were three years of data available across all five cities: 2015, 2016, and 2017. The relationships we asked questions about were Overall Satisfaction vs. Price, Number of Reviews vs. Price, Room Type vs. Overall Satisfaction, and Number of Reviews vs. Overall Satisfaction.
